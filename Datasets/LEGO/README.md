#Context
LEGO is a popular brand of toy building bricks. They are often sold in sets with in order to build a specific object. Each set contains a number of parts in different shapes, sizes and colors. This database contains information on which parts are included in different LEGO sets. It was originally compiled to help people who owned some LEGO sets already figure out what other sets they could build with the pieces they had.

#Possible Explorations
- How have the size of sets changed over time?
- What colors are associated with witch themes? Could you predict which theme a set is from just by the bricks it contains?
- What sets have the most-used pieces in them? What sets have the rarest pieces in them?
- Have the colors of LEGOs included in sets changed over time?
